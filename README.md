# Supervised Classification of Land Cover Types in Southern Santa Barbara County, CA


## Purpose
The purpose behind this project is to test whether or not LiDAR is a worthy tool of geospatial analysis, especially in terms of the classification of land cover. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)" is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances to the Earth”(americangeosciences.org). Reclassifying an image to help predict land cover type is a very useful tool to help record whether or not it changes over time.
